# BarionRuneEff
Framework only, will eventually(hopefully) become a windowed program.

This program uses Java FX for Windowed Application.

This program should look like a mess because I don't know how to program at all. Random visitor, enjoy your cringe, and don't do what I did.

Barion's Rune Efficiency is a equation made by, well, Barion. This equation calculates the efficiency of a rune in a phone app Summoners War. It takes the maximum possible value of a rune stat, the rune level, and the rune value. This was created before the runestone and gemstones are created. Rune efficiency can exceed over 100% with it.

This is not yet completely implemented. This should be regarded as basically "canceled" since I lost interest over the game. Plus, my knowledge of Java as a whole is severly lacking, and thus I don't think I'm suited for this. There already exists websites out there which also doubles as a rune tracker. In other words, I'm only going to work on this if I possess adaquate skills and wants to have some challenge.
